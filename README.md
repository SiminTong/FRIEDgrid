# FRIEDgrid

FRIEDv2 readme.

Columns are
Host star mass [Msol],
Disc outer radius [au],
Surface density at 1au [gcm-2] (This is just the surface density normalization for the an R^{-1} surface density profile. Use the next column, not this one, in disc evolutionary models.)
Surface density at disc outer edge [gcm-2],
FUV field strength at outer edge of grid [G0],
Mass loss rate [log10(Msol/yr)],

Filenames
---------------

For example
FRIED2022_0p1Msol_fPAH0p1_growth.dat

is for a 0.1 solar mass star, a PAH-to-dust mass ratio (f_PAH) of 0.1 that in the ISM and assumes grain growth and drift has occured in the disc outer to the disc outer edge

and

FRIED2022_3p0Msol_fPAH1p0_ism.dat

is for a 3.0 solar mass star, a PAH-to-dust mass ratio (f_PAH) of 1.0 that in the ISM and assumes the dust in the disc outer regions is still ISM-like. 


friedgrid_original.dat is the original version of the grid, where the columns are:
Host star mass [Msol],
FUV field strength at outer edge of grid [G0],
Disc gas mass [Jupiter masses],
Surface density at the disc outer edge [g/cm^2]
Disc outer radius [AU]
Mass loss rate [log10(Msol/yr)]
